## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in Atom Guard, please report it responsibly.

**DO NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### How to Report

Please email us at **security@atomguard.dev** or use GitHub Security Advisories if available.

### Our Process

1.  We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
2.  We will investigate the issue and determine its impact.
3.  We will work on a patch and release a security update.
4.  We will publicly announce the fix after a reasonable time has passed for users to update.

### Bounties

We currently do not have a paid bug bounty program, but we will credit you in our release notes and security hall of fame.
